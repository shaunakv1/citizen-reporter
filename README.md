A App for ESRI Hackathon 2014 Palm Springs 

###Description
Citizen Reporter provides cloud sourced event reporting for emergency management.  Citizens can report various incidents that are then visible to emergency management personnel via an administrative dashboard.  What makes this app unique is that the visibility and validity of an incident is partly derived by the open reporting community.  As more users report the same incident, emergency management personnel can begin to interpret the event as an ‘authoritative’ event and move toward an appropriate response.  With the click of a button, emergency response teams can be notified of the event (sms, email) with the following details:

* Event Type
* Event Time
* Assets within radius of event
* Address
